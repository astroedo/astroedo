## 🚀 Key Projects

### Glacier Melting temporal classification 
* Technologies: Random Forest, MLP, GEE, Google Colab
* Details: Developed and applied Random Forest and MLP models on 40 years of Landsat data (1,178 samples) for temporal glacier classification.
* Results: Achieved 97% accuracy on external validation across Alpine glaciers

### TerraMind Land Cover Scene Classification - Romania
* Technologies: Prithvi & TerraMind GFMs, TerraTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Google Colab
* Details: Fine-tuned Prithvi EO v2 and TerraMind v1 foundation models on Romania LUCAS ground truth data (100+ samples, 7-band HLS imagery) for 10-class land cover scene classification.
* Results: Successfully implemented and compared two state-of-the-art geospatial foundation models, demonstrating practical transfer learning for downstream classification tasks with limited training samples.
